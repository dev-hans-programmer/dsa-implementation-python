## Overview

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in sequence, but unlike arrays, the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Types Implemented

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes

## Theory

### Singly Linked List Structure
