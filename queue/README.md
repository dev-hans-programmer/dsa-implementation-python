## Overview

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front). Think of it like a line of people waiting - the first person to join the line is the first to be served.

### Key Characteristics

- **FIFO Ordering**: First element added is the first to be removed
- **Two-Ended Access**: Insert at rear, remove from front
- **Dynamic Size**: Grows and shrinks during runtime
- **Fair Scheduling**: Maintains insertion order
