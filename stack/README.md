## Overview

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top" of the stack. Think of it like a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top.

### Key Characteristics

- **LIFO Ordering**: Last element added is the first to be removed
- **Restricted Access**: Can only access the top element
- **Dynamic Size**: Grows and shrinks during runtime
- **Two Main Operations**: Push (add) and Pop (remove)
