## Overview

A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects and are fundamental in computer science for solving connectivity, pathfinding, and network analysis problems.

### Key Characteristics

- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Individual data points in the graph
- **Edges**: Connections between vertices
- **Directed vs Undirected**: Edges can have direction or be bidirectional
- **Weighted vs Unweighted**: Edges can have associated costs/distances
- **Connected vs Disconnected**: All vertices reachable vs separate components

## Theory

### Graph Types

#### Undirected Graph
```
A --- B
|     |
|     |
C --- D
```
- Edges have no direction
- If A connects to B, then B connects to A
- Used for: Social networks, road networks, electrical circuits

#### Directed Graph (Digraph)
```
A --> B
|     |
v     v
C --> D
```
- Edges have direction (one-way connections)
- A â†’ B doesn't imply B â†’ A
- Used for: Web links, task dependencies, state machines

### Graph Representations

#### Adjacency List (Our Implementation)
```python
{
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'D'],
    'D': ['B', 'C']
}
```
- Space efficient for sparse graphs: O(V + E)
- Fast neighbor lookup: O(1)
- Edge existence check: O(degree)

#### Adjacency Matrix
```python
    A  B  C  D
A [ 0  1  1  0 ]
B [ 1  0  0  1 ]
C [ 1  0  0  1 ]
D [ 0  1  1  0 ]
```
- Space: O(VÂ²)
- Fast edge lookup: O(1)
- Better for dense graphs

### Graph Traversal Algorithms

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as deep as possible before backtracking
- Uses stack (recursive or explicit)
- Applications: Cycle detection, topological sorting, pathfinding

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores all neighbors before going deeper
- Uses queue
- Applications: Shortest path (unweighted), level-order traversal

## Implementation Details

### GraphNode Class

```python
class GraphNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.neighbors = set()
        self.visited = False
```

### Graph Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Add vertex | O(1) | O(1) |
| Add edge | O(1) | O(1) |
| Remove vertex | O(V + E) | O(1) |
| Remove edge | O(1) | O(1) |
| DFS/BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| Shortest path | O(V + E) | O(V) |

### Core Methods

#### Graph Construction
```python
graph = Graph(directed=False)
graph.add_vertex("A")
graph.add_edge("A", "B", weight=5.0)
```

#### Traversal
```python
dfs_order = graph.depth_first_search("A")
bfs_order = graph.breadth_first_search("A")
```

#### Path Finding
```python
path = graph.find_shortest_path("A", "Z")
```

## Time and Space Complexity

### Space Complexity
- **Adjacency List**: O(V + E)
  - V vertices + E edges storage
  - Optimal for sparse graphs
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(V) for traversal algorithms
  - Visited set and queue/stack

### Time Complexity by Operation

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Add Vertex** | O(1) | Graph construction |
| **Add Edge** | O(1) | Graph construction |
| **DFS** | O(V + E) | Connectivity, cycles |
| **BFS** | O(V + E) | Shortest path |
| **Shortest Path** | O(V + E) | Unweighted graphs |
| **Dijkstra** | O((V + E) log V) | Weighted graphs |

### Performance Characteristics

- **Dense Graphs** (E â‰ˆ VÂ²): Adjacency matrix preferred
- **Sparse Graphs** (E â‰ˆ V): Adjacency list preferred
- **Memory Usage**: Linear in vertices and edges

## Usage Examples

### Basic Graph Operations

```python
from implementation import Graph

# Create undirected graph
graph = Graph(directed=False)

# Add vertices
cities = ['NYC', 'Boston', 'DC', 'Atlanta']
for city in cities:
    graph.add_vertex(city)

# Add edges (connections)
graph.add_edge('NYC', 'Boston')
graph.add_edge('NYC', 'DC')
graph.add_edge('DC', 'Atlanta')

print(graph)  # Display graph structure
```

### Graph Traversal

```python
# Depth-First Search
dfs_order = graph.depth_first_search('NYC')
print(f"DFS: {dfs_order}")

# Breadth-First Search
bfs_order = graph.breadth_first_search('NYC')
print(f"BFS: {bfs_order}")

# Check connectivity
print(f"Connected: {len(dfs_order) == graph.vertex_count()}")
```

### Shortest Path Finding

```python
# Find shortest path
path = graph.find_shortest_path('NYC', 'Atlanta')
if path:
    print(f"Route: {' â†’ '.join(path)}")
    print(f"Stops: {len(path) - 1}")
else:
    print("No path found")
```

```python
# Create social network
social = Graph(directed=False)

# Add users
users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana']
for user in users:
    social.add_vertex(user)

# Add friendships
friendships = [('Alice', 'Bob'), ('Bob', 'Charlie'), ('Charlie', 'Diana')]
for user1, user2 in friendships:
    social.add_edge(user1, user2)

# Find mutual friends
alice_friends = set(social.get_neighbors('Alice'))
diana_friends = set(social.get_neighbors('Diana'))
mutual = alice_friends.intersection(diana_friends)
print(f"Mutual friends: {list(mutual)}")

# Find connection path
path = social.find_shortest_path('Alice', 'Diana')

    ('Central', 'University'),
    ('University', 'Mall'),
    ('Mall', 'Hospital'),
    ('Airport', 'Hospital')
]

for station1, station2 in routes:
    transport.add_edge(station1, station2)

# Find route
route = transport.find_shortest_path('Central', 'Hospital')
print(f"Route to Hospital: {' â†’ '.join(route)}")

# Analyze connectivity

    reachable = transport.breadth_first_search(station)
    print(f"From {station}: {len(reachable)} reachable stations")
```

web = Graph(directed=True)

]

for from_page, to_page in links:
    web.add_edge(from_page, to_page)

# Find all pages reachable from home
reachable = web.depth_first_search('home.html')
print(f"Pages reachable from home: {reachable}")

# Find pages with no incoming links (entry points)
